This Java project implements a simple fighter battle simulator. The program defines a Fighter class with attributes such as name, damage, health, weight, and dodge, allowing users to create instances of fighters and simulate battles. The Match class orchestrates the match between two fighters, considering factors like dodge chance and weight constraints. The simulation progresses through rounds, alternating attacks until one fighter's health reaches zero. Key learnings from the project include object-oriented programming principles, conditional statements, looping structures, and incorporating randomness. The code provides an introductory hands-on experience in Java programming, offering flexibility for further customization and exploration.
